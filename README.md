# Vanilla JS is Easy

Look, how many counter click on me tutorials are there for all the frameworks? How much time do you spend wrestling with frameworks rather than making things look right or behave correctly?

This is a gosh darn vanilla JS counter in literally 15 lines of code.

It couldn't be simpler.

Yea, there's a closure. Who cares. Closures are the easiest, most transparent things in the whole world. They're fundamentally part of Javascript and fundamentally part of functional programming. That's cool. Does your framework let you use closures? Why aren't you writing functional components in whatever and storing the state in closures?
